# Temperature-Control-System.
It compares the value of the temperature with the high and low temperatures.
Objective:
It takes the high and low temperatures from the user. If the temperature is less than a specified minimum value, a heater should be on. 
If the temperature is greater than a specified maximum value, a cooler should be on. The heater and cooler are off while the temperature 
is between its minimum and maximum values.
Project Overview:
This project involves developing a temperature control system that adjusts fan and heater  based on environmental conditions:
1. Fan Control: The LM35 temperature sensor adjusts the fan proportionally to the room temperature if it is above the or equal the room temperture.
2. LCD Display: Shows real-time temperature readings, status(Norm,Hot,Cold), high temperture and low temperture.
3.  Heater: The LM35 temperature sensor turns the heater proportionally to the room temperature if it is below low temperture .
